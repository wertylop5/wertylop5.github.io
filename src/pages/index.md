## Hey!

I’m Stanley and I’m currently a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I’m mainly a software developer experienced with full stack web development, but I’ve been branching out to other areas such as mobile development as well.

I’ve been a software engineer intern at Uber, where I worked in the Advanced Technologies Group to help develop an autonomous vehicle. During the school year, I was a project lead on my project team, Cornell Cup Robotics, where I led a group of undergraduate students to build a chatbot for our semiautonomous lab assistant robot. In the past, I’ve also done research that combines robotics and computer vision to accomplish the task of building furniture.

Other projects I’ve pursued in my free time and in class include creating a ray tracing engine from scratch and building a REST API for a facial recognition system.

When I’m not at my computer, I enjoy skiing, swimming, and teaching myself the drums. I also know how to play the diabolo (feel free to ask me what it is)!

I look forward to meeting you!
