I was part of my high school's Zero Robotics team, StuyNaught.

This competition involves programming robots in a language similar to C to maneuver in zero-gravity conditions to accomplish various tasks. These programs are eventually deployed on SPHERE robots aboard the International Space Station.

I worked on improving the mobility of the robot as well as devising strategies to accomplish the tasks given each year.

Our team has reached the international finals very year of the team's existence (except for one) and placed 1st in the 2017-2018 season.

In my senior year, I led a team of 20 students and collaborated with another international team of 10 students.
