## Hey!

Hi! I’m Stanley and I’m currently a sophomore majoring in computer science and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I am a software developer, and I’ve been branching out to other areas such as computer vision as well. 

I’m currently a project lead on my project team, Cornell Cup Robotics, where I’m leading a group of undergraduate students to build a chatbot for our semiautonomous lab assistant robot. In the past, I’ve also done research that combines robotics and computer vision to accomplish the task of building furniture. Other projects I’ve pursued include creating a ray tracing engine from scratch to building a REST API for a facial recognition system.

When I’m not at my computer, I enjoy skiing, swimming, and teaching myself the drums. I also know how to play the diabolo/Chinese Yoyo (feel free to ask me what it is)!

I look forward to meeting you!
