				Hi! I’m Stanley and I’m currently a freshman studying computer science at Cornell University’s College of Engineering. I am a software developer, but I’ve been branching out to other areas such as computer vision as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from a ray tracing engine written from scratch to a chatbot that recommends movies! Feel free to visit my Github to see the code for some of my projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was also the lead programmer and captain of my high school’s Zero Robotics team, StuyNaught. Currently, I'm a member of Cornell Cup Robotics, and am currently working on a project involving facial recognition.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not at my computer, I enjoy skiing, swimming, and teaching myself the drums. I also know how to play the diabolo (feel free to ask me what it is)!
			</p>
			<p>
				Feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have!
			</p>
